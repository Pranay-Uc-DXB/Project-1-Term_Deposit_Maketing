# Project 1 - Term Deposit Marketing / kJwDbOK3EHpxtQrA

This project pertains to the Finance and Banking industry. A small startup catering to the European Banking Market was looking to optimize its success rate with one of its marketing campaigns. 

The company wanted to build a robust machine-learning system from data coming from a call center via the marketing effort of a European banking institution. 

The goal was to analyze data, design, and implement a machine-learning model that would solve the following:

1) Predict if the customer will subscribe (yes/no) to a term deposit
2) Whcih customers are likely to buy the investment product? Determine the segments that the firm must prioritize
3) What makes the customers buy? Tell us which feature we should be focusing more on?
